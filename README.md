# Soccer-Game
A Java program that simmulates a soccer game. The user uses the mouse to move the soccer ball and to shoot it into the goal. The user must avoid the goalie in order to make a goal, and they have to score a certain number of points within a time frame to advance to the next level. As the user moves up to the next level there is another goalie that is introduced and the goalies move faster from side to side in front of the goal to make the game more challenging to the player.
